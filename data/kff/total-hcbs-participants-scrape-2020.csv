Totals may not sum due to rounding. 

Blank cell indicates state does not elect option. 

Total people receiving HCBS across all authorities is not presented as individuals may receive services under more than one authority.

Data represents people receiving HCBS across four Medicaid state plan benefits (home health, personal care, Section 1915 (i), and Community First Choice (CFC)) and two waiver authorities (Section 1915 (c) and Section 1115). 

Home health state plan services include part-time or intermittent nursing services, home health aide services, medical supplies, and equipment and appliances suitable for use at home. At the state option, these services include physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech pathology and audiology services. 
Personal care services include assistance with self-care and household activities.
Community First Choice services include attendant services and supports for people who would otherwise require institutional care. 
Section 1915 (i) services may include case management, homemaker/home health aide/personal care services, adult day health, habilitation, respite, day treatment/partial hospitalization, psychosocial rehabilitation, chronic mental health clinic services, and/or other services approved by the HHS secretary.
