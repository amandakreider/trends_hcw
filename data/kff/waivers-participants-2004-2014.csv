NOTES: Data may not sum to total due to rounding. Arizona did not operate a § 1915(c) waiver over the study period because all HCBS were provided through a § 1115 managed care waiver. Rhode Island terminated its § 1915(c) waivers in mid-2009 and provided services under a § 1115 waiver. Vermont terminated its § 1915(c) waivers in 2006 and provided services under a § 1115 waiver. New Jersey operated one 1915(c) waiver in 2014 however the most recent 372 report accepted by CMS is from 2011. A dash indicates that there was no operational § 1915(c) waiver that year.,,,,,,,,,,,
